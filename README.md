- 👋 Hi, I’m @HansvAnkeren
- 👀 I’m interested in cloud computing, cybersecurity and DevOps from a technology (what), process (how) and organizational (who) perspective.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become an awesome (Azure) system administrator and DevOps engineer. In a rapid changing environment this means a lot of time spent on learning! I recommend Microsoft Learn.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on many topics in the future, for now I'm exploring the field in its width (not so much depth).
- 📫 How to reach me: hans.van.ankeren@movares.nl.
